# ðŸŽ¥ Video to Text Transcription App

This is a **Streamlit** app that extracts audio from a video file and transcribes it into text using **OpenAI's Whisper model**. You can upload video files, choose different Whisper model sizes, and adjust the chunk duration for transcription. The app supports multiple languages, and you can specify a language code for transcription or let the app detect it automatically.

## ðŸ“š How to Use the App


- Open the app in your browser by going to http://localhost:8501.
- Upload a Video File: Drag and drop a video file (up to 1GB) into the upload box.
- Select Whisper Model: Choose the Whisper model size based on your preference. Larger models provide more accuracy but take longer to transcribe.
- Language Code: Optionally, provide a language code (e.g., 'en' for English or 'es' for Spanish) or leave it blank for auto-detection.
- Chunk Duration: Use the slider to adjust the duration of each audio chunk to be transcribed.
- Start Transcription: Click the "Start Transcription" button to begin the process. You will see progress updates as each chunk is transcribed.
- Download the Result: After transcription, download the resulting text file.

## ðŸ§  Model Information

The transcription is powered by OpenAI's Whisper model, a powerful speech recognition model capable of transcribing in multiple languages with high accuracy.
